Interaction expansion quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver: An open-source implementation of the continuous-time interaction-expansion quantum Monte Carlo method.

This program solves impurity models with general instantaneous two-body interactions and complex non-interaction Green's function.
The code is built on the ALPS libraries (Applications and Libraries for Physics Simulations).

The code was written by H. Shinaoka in collaboration with Yusuke Nomura.
