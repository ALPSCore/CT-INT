CT-INT
======

Interaction expansion quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver: An open-source implementation of the continuous-time interaction-expansion quantum Monte Carlo method.

This program solves impurity models with general instantaneous two-body interactions and complex imaginary-time Green's function.
The code is built on the ALPSCore libraries (Applications and Libraries for Physics Simulations Core libraries).

The code was written by H. Shinaoka in collaboration with Yusuke Nomura based on its ancestor written by Emanuel Gull.
